Description: Several dozen low-level utilities and codes from the Interactive Data Language (IDL) Astronomy Users Library (http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov) are implemented in R.  They treat: time, coordinate and proper motion transformations; terrestrial precession and nutation, atmospheric refraction and aberration, barycentric corrections, and related effects; utilities for astrometry, photometry, and spectroscopy; and utilities for planetary, stellar, Galactic, and extragalactic science.
